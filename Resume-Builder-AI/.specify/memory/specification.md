**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Implementation Complete  
**Input**: User description: "AI-powered resume tailoring application with comprehensive analytics"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Resume Tailoring (Priority: P1)

A job seeker wants to optimize their resume for a specific job posting by getting AI-powered suggestions for improvements, keyword optimization, and tailored bullet points.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the application. Without this functionality, the platform has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pasting a resume and job description, then verifying that AI-generated suggestions are returned with actionable recommendations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has pasted their resume and a job description, **When** they click "Tailor My Resume", **Then** they receive AI-generated suggestions for improvement
2. **Given** the OpenAI API is unavailable, **When** a user requests resume tailoring, **Then** they receive demo suggestions with clear indication of demo mode
3. **Given** a user submits empty fields, **When** they click "Tailor My Resume", **Then** they receive an error message asking for both resume and job description

### User Story 2 - Analytics Dashboard (Priority: P2)

A project administrator wants to understand user behavior, popular keywords, and system performance through a comprehensive analytics dashboard.

**Why this priority**: Analytics provide crucial insights for product improvement and help identify popular job markets and user needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the analytics dashboard and verifying that usage statistics, keyword trends, and performance metrics are displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** users have used the resume tailoring feature, **When** an admin accesses the analytics dashboard, **Then** they see usage statistics, success rates, and popular keywords
2. **Given** the analytics dashboard is accessed, **When** viewing daily activity charts, **Then** data is displayed in interactive charts with proper time ranges
3. **Given** no usage data exists, **When** accessing the analytics dashboard, **Then** empty states are shown with appropriate messaging

### User Story 3 - Session Tracking & Privacy (Priority: P3)

The system needs to track user sessions for analytics while maintaining user privacy and not storing personal information.

**Why this priority**: Essential for analytics functionality while maintaining user trust and privacy compliance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that session IDs are generated, user actions are tracked anonymously, and no personal data is stored permanently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the application, **When** they interact with the system, **Then** their actions are tracked with an anonymous session ID
2. **Given** user data is processed, **When** the system handles resume and job descriptions, **Then** no personal information is stored in the database
3. **Given** analytics data is collected, **When** viewing the data, **Then** all information is aggregated and anonymized

### User Story 4 - Error Handling & User Experience (Priority: P3)

Users need clear feedback when errors occur, with helpful guidance on how to resolve issues.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user experience and system reliability, ensuring users understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating various error conditions and verifying that appropriate error messages are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the server is not running, **When** a user tries to tailor their resume, **Then** they receive a clear error message with instructions
2. **Given** the OpenAI API returns an error, **When** a user requests resume tailoring, **Then** they receive fallback suggestions or clear error messaging
3. **Given** network connectivity issues occur, **When** a user interacts with the system, **Then** they receive appropriate feedback about connectivity problems
