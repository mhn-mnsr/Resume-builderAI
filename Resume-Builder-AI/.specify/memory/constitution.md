# Resume Builder AI Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
Every feature must prioritize user experience and accessibility. The application MUST be intuitive for job seekers of all technical levels. User feedback drives feature prioritization. All interfaces must be responsive and accessible across devices and browsers.

### II. AI-Powered Intelligence
Leverage AI to provide personalized, actionable resume improvement suggestions. The system MUST analyze job descriptions to extract key requirements and match them with user qualifications. AI responses must be specific, measurable, and implementable.

### III. Privacy & Security (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
User data protection is paramount. All resume and job description data MUST be processed securely. API keys and sensitive information MUST be stored server-side only. No personal data should be logged or stored permanently without explicit user consent.

### IV. Analytics-Driven Improvement
Comprehensive analytics tracking is mandatory for continuous improvement. The system MUST track user behavior, success rates, popular keywords, and conversion metrics. All analytics must be privacy-compliant and provide actionable insights for feature development.

### V. Performance & Reliability
The application MUST respond to user requests within 3 seconds. All API calls must have proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. The system MUST gracefully handle API quota limits and provide meaningful feedback to users.

## Security & Privacy Requirements

- All API keys MUST be stored in environment variables, never in client-side code
- User sessions MUST be tracked anonymously with UUID-based identifiers
- Resume and job description data MUST be processed in memory only, not permanently stored
- Analytics data MUST be aggregated and anonymized
- HTTPS MUST be enforced in production environments
- Input validation MUST prevent XSS and injection attacks

## Performance Standards

- Page load times MUST be under 2 seconds
- API response times MUST be under 3 seconds
- Database queries MUST be optimized with proper indexing
- Frontend assets MUST be minified and cached appropriately
- Error handling MUST provide clear, actionable feedback to users

## Development Workflow

- All features MUST be developed with comprehensive analytics tracking
- Code reviews MUST verify security best practices and performance considerations
- Testing MUST include both unit tests and integration tests for API endpoints
- Documentation MUST be updated for all new features and API changes
- Deployment MUST include proper environment variable configuration

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the proposed change and rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing features and user experience
3. Security and privacy review for any data handling changes
4. Performance impact evaluation
5. Approval from project maintainers

All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear user value. Use the project README and documentation for runtime development guidance.
