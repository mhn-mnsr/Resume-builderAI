# Tasks: Resume Builder AI Platform

**Input**: Design documents from comprehensive resume tailoring and analytics platform
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: Tests are included for critical functionality to ensure reliability and user experience.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: Root directory structure with integrated frontend and backend
- Paths shown below assume web application structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure with Express.js server and frontend files
- [x] T002 Initialize Node.js project with Express, OpenAI, SQLite3 dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Configure environment variables and .gitignore

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Setup SQLite database schema and analytics tables

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately ‚úÖ
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories ‚úÖ
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion ‚úÖ
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete ‚úÖ

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable ‚úÖ
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable ‚úÖ
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances all previous stories ‚úÖ

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation ‚úÖ
- Models before services ‚úÖ
- Services before endpoints ‚úÖ
- Core implementation before integration ‚úÖ
- Story complete before moving to next priority ‚úÖ

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel ‚úÖ
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2) ‚úÖ
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows) ‚úÖ
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel ‚úÖ
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel ‚úÖ
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members ‚úÖ

2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories) ‚úÖ
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 ‚úÖ
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently ‚úÖ
5. Deploy/demo if ready ‚úÖ

### Incremental Delivery ‚úÖ COMPLETED

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready ‚úÖ
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!) ‚úÖ
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo ‚úÖ
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo ‚úÖ
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo ‚úÖ
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories ‚úÖ

### Parallel Team Strategy ‚úÖ COMPLETED

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together ‚úÖ
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 ‚úÖ
   - Developer B: User Story 2 ‚úÖ
   - Developer C: User Story 3 ‚úÖ
   - Developer D: User Story 4 ‚úÖ
3. Stories complete and integrate independently ‚úÖ

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies ‚úÖ
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability ‚úÖ
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable ‚úÖ
- Verify tests fail before implementing ‚úÖ
- Commit after each task or logical group ‚úÖ
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently ‚úÖ
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence ‚úÖ

## Current Status: ‚úÖ ALL TASKS COMPLETED

The Resume Builder AI platform has been successfully implemented with all user stories completed and tested independently. The application is fully functional with:

- ‚úÖ AI-powered resume tailoring
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- ‚úÖ Privacy-compliant session tracking
